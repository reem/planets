# Planets and Gravity

A small planetary simulator that generates many random planets and causes them
to exert gravity on each other.

Unlike a similar project of mine, which uses D3, this one calculates gravity more
realistically and does not use a library for the forces.

This is was originally a project from [Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum. 
This project was worked on with a pair.
